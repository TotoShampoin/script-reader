My name is TotoShampoin. And you are about to listen "Inside and Outside"

Before we start, I invite you to put yourself in a comfortable position, 
be it laying, or sitting, 
as long as you feel ready to relax in it.
And once you are in fact ready,
you can start relaxing yourself,
and focus on my voice, as you listen.

Now, picture yourself standing in front of a pathway in the green plains.
It goes a long way ahead, and you can't really see the tail.
But the environment around it feels charming, cozy, attractive.
You kind of want to travel along this path.

So, having all the time that you need, 
you start walking into it.
You put your first foot on its ground,
and you start making your steps into the pathway.

As you walk in it, you can see the landscapes scrolling all around you.
You can see the grass, you can see the flowers, 
and most importantly, you can see the pathway.

And with each step that you make down that pathway,
you can take a slow, deep breath of the fresh air around you.
You can take a slow, deep breath in,
And a slow, deep breath out.
And you can feel your body relaxing, 
as you keep walking down the pathway.

And the deeper you go into that road,
the more relaxed your body becomes,
and the better you can feel.

From this point, in the distance, 
you can start having sights,
of what appears to be a forest.
A nice and cozy, green forest, ahead around the pathway.

And as you slowly approach it, 
you can start counting the miles you have to walk,
until you manage to reach this point.
Counting from 10 to zero,
you can keep track of the distance between you and the forest.
And with each number you count, you take another slow deep breath,
and you feel a wave of relaxation going through your entire body.
And as you do, you will surely reach a nice, hypnotic trance, by the time you reach zero.

Now, as you walk down the road, you start counting the distance.
Starting with a 10,
as you take, with each count, a slow, deep breath, inhaling and exhaling.
With a 9,
as you bring your focus more and more to the front,
With an 8,
as you leave all your worries, all your stress behind your back,
With a 7,
you can feel your body relaxing more and more.
With a 6,
you can feel the relaxation spreading to your mind.
With a 5,
a wave of relaxation passes through your entire body, and you entire mind.
With a 4,
the relaxation feels so good, as you see the trees getting closer, and closer.
With a 3,
you are not even thinking about your surroundings anymore.
With a 2,
you are nearly inside the forest, and you can feel your mind getting emptier, and emptier.
With a 1,
you enter the forest completely, feeling its aura relaxing you even more.
And with a zero:
You have dropped into TRANCE.

And as you are in fact, in a trance, you keep walking ahead, along the pathway.
The warmth of the forest fuzzes your mind, as you walk in it.
And it feels so good, so relaxing.

And as you walk deeper along this road, inside the forest,
You feel your body, relaxing more and more,
You feel your mind, drifting further and further,
You feel yourself, going deeper and deeper,
Into a nice, pleasing, hypnotic trance,
As you walk inside the forest.

Now, as you may be aware,
A forest isn't always full of trees.
There might be parts, where there are little to no trees,
And other parts, where there are lots and lots of trees.

On this pathway, as you walk among the trees, 
Being inside the forest,
You can feel your mind drifting away, dropping deep into trance, and further.

And as you walk around more landscape and less trees,
Being outside the forest,
You can feel your mind coming back, 
As you come out of this trance,
Feeling awake, and refreshed,
Aware of all that is happening.

And as you walk, once again, inside the forest,
You feel your mind gradually going back into a blissful trance, 
Going even further that you did earlier,
Just listening to my voice, letting me guide you.

And as you walk, outside the forest,
You feel your mind gradually coming back out of this trance,
Becoming aware of the trees, of the grass, of everything.

Then you reach the trees again, going inside the forest.
Sinking deeper.

And then you leave the trees again, going outside the forest.
Waking up from the trance.

And then you walk inside the forest.
And then you walk outside the forest.

And then, back inside.

Outside,
And inside.
Outside,
And inside.
Outside again,
And inside again.

And as you are outside,
You wait for the next trees to arrive and drip you again.

And as you do get back inside,
You do feel your mind slipping again, further into a nice, hypnotic trance.

Then you walk outside again,
And then inside again.

And outside.
And inside.

Outside,
Inside.
Outside,
Inside.
Outside,
Inside.
Outside,
Inside.
Outside,
Inside.

You may have noticed, while you walk outside,
That this forest has a lot of variations, like now, as you walk inside.
But it doesn't matter, doesn't it?
All of that is unimportant, is that you walk outside,
And then inside.
Because you just relax, and listen,
As you walk outside,
Then inside.

You are feeling so relaxed.
Outside.
And it's getting easier and easier to drop.
Inside.
As it is harder and harder to wake up.
Outside.
Isn't it?
Inside.
Outside.

And back inside.

Though, you must start feeling so confused now.
You are inside the forest. Definitely in a trance.
But as you walk outside,
Are you truly awake?
Maybe, maybe not.
Yet, you walk inside again.

Falling so deep into trance.
Feeling so good, and so relaxed.

And outside, 
You're feeling just as good and relaxed.
And inside,
As you're feeling the trance within you.

Dropping deeper, and deeper.
Going further, and further.
Relaxing more, and more.

You may have stopped keeping tracks of the trees,
Since there are a lot, in the end,
And they make you feel so mindless, so empty, so entranced.
Each and every tree making you relax more, and more.

And it feels so good to relax,
Because of the trees.

In fact, you are feeling so good, so deep,
That in a moment, when I give a signal,
Your body is going to pause the video,
To scroll down, and write a comment.
You will be writing the following sentence:
"I love the trees, they make me relax".
And once it is written, once it is sent,
You will go back to the video, and resume it.

Now, if you understand, if you feel ready,
Thenâ€¦ you may start doing so.
Right now.

And you walk back inside the forest,
And outside the forest,
Inside,
Outside,
And inside again.

Feeling this blissful confusion, this pleasing trance.

And soon enough, you can start to see the end of the forest, 
and the end of the road.

It is approaching, from the far distance,
And as it does, you may start to feel yourself slowly coming back up.

As I count down, with a 10, 
You just know you are about to come out.
With a 9,
You can start to feel some glimpses of thought again,
Thinking about the trees, or how good they make you feel.
With an 8,
Thinking about how relaxed you are, and how relaxed you have been.
With a 7,
Remembering all that has happened to you, during all of this.
With a 6,
Starting to regain awareness, bit by bit.
With a 5,
Becoming aware of yourself, and your surroundings.
With a 4, 
Your energy coming back, feeling refreshed
With a 3,
The light is just there, and soon enough, you are outside of the forest, for good.
With a 2,
You walk past the last trees, and you can feel yourself leaving the trance.
And with a 1,
You may come out of this hypnotic trance, come back to your senses, 

And you may just Wake Up.
Feeling refreshed, completely aware, and remembering everything that happened. 

I hope that you have enjoyed this session.

And I wish you to have a nice day, or a nice night.
